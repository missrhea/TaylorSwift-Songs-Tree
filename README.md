Start a python server in the project directory.

~~`$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`~~

That was the way to start a server before python3.

In python 3 the 'SimpleHTTPServer' module has been merged into 'http.server'. The equivalent way to spin up a server is,

`$ python -m http.server 8080`

Open the local host on port 8080, i.e. in a browser go to http://localhost:8080/
